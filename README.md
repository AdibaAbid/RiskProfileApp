# Risk Profile App

Risk Profile App is a React Native application designed to help users determine their risk profile by answering a series of questions. The app calculates a score based on the user's answers and categorizes their risk level as **Low**, **Medium**, or **High**.

## üöÄ Features

- **Welcome Screen**: Introduces the app and allows users to start the quiz.
- **Questionnaire Screen**: Displays a series of questions with multiple-choice answers.
- **Result Screen**: Shows the user's calculated score and risk category, with options to retake the quiz or return to the home screen.
- **Dynamic Questionnaire**: Presents users with multiple questions and choices.
- **Real-time Scoring**: Calculates total score and determines risk category (Low, Medium, High).
- **State Management**: Uses Zustand for lightweight and scalable state handling.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Seamless transitions between screens using React Navigation.
- **Error Handling**: Alerts users if questions are left unanswered.
- **Retake Option**: Allows users to retake the quiz or return to the welcome screen.
- **Theming**: Consistent UI with a custom theme.
- **Testing**: Includes Jest and React Testing Library tests for components and logic.

## üõ† Technology Stack

- React Native + TypeScript
- Zustand (state management)
- React Navigation (routing)
- Jest & React Testing Library (testing)

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the app on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **React Native CLI**: Install globally using `npm install -g react-native-cli`
- **Android Studio** (for Android development) or **Xcode** (for iOS development)
- **CocoaPods** (for iOS dependencies): Install using `sudo gem install cocoapods`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AdibaAbid/RiskProfileApp.git
   cd RiskProfileApp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   # Using npm

   ```

### Running the App

#### Start Metro

Metro is the JavaScript bundler for React Native. Start Metro by running:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

#### Run on Android

Ensure you have an Android emulator running or a physical device connected.

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### Run on iOS

Ensure you have Xcode installed and an iOS simulator running.

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

### Testing

This project uses **Jest** for unit testing. Run the tests using:

```sh
# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run tests in watch mode
yarn run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
yarn run test:coverage
```

### Code Coverage

The project aims for **80% code coverage**. You can view the coverage report by running:

```sh
npm run test:coverage
```

The coverage report will be generated in the `coverage` directory.
